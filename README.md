# A Bayesian Modern Look at Multi-Armed Bandits

## Project Overview

This project explores the **multi-armed bandit problem** using **Bayesian methods**, specifically focusing on the **Randomized Probability Matching (RPM)** algorithm. The work aims to demonstrate how Bayesian approaches balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, minimizing regret and converging to optimal decisions efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Armed Bandit Problem**: A sequential decision-making scenario aiming to maximize cumulative rewards from unknown payoff distributions.
- **Randomized Probability Matching (RPM)**: A Bayesian algorithm that assigns probabilities to each arm based on posterior distributions, enabling efficient exploration and exploitation.

---

## Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. **Binomial Bandits**:
   - Models arms with binary outcomes (success/failure).
   - Uses posterior Beta distributions to estimate arm probabilities.
   - Visualizations demonstrate how RPM quickly converges to optimal arms while minimizing regret.

2. **Linear Bandits**:
   - Generalizes bandits to continuous outcomes using regression models.
   - Explores the impact of structured environments and evaluates RPM's performance under linear assumptions.
